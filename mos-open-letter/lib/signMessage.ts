  'Our Digital Revolution Needs a New Mindset \n' +
  'We are at the dawn of a new era, and web3 is just the beginning. As the space evolves, it awakens never-ending possibilities. But with the energy of innovation comes strain, overwhelm and exhaustion. To be a meaningful part of this movement, it can feel like we must always be on, always connected, always available and always doing. \n' +
  'We’re all working together to radically reclaim the web and our digital identities, but what if we could, at the same time, revolutionise our minds to uplevel our wellbeing? \n' +

  'Wellbeing Contradictions in Web3\n' +
  'Web3 lets us create and dream without barriers, but limitless potential can become all-consuming and burn us out \n' +
  'Hyper-connectivity can make our expansive world feel closer than ever but can also leave us feeling isolated and triggered by the pressure of FOMO and competition \n' +
  'This high-stakes world is captivating, but its rapid progress can command our attention 24/7, and we forget to reclaim it \n' +
  'We are here for this movement, but we want to pioneer a new mindset that can allow us to bring about radical change while still protecting our wellbeing. As we work together to claim digital autonomy, can we reclaim autonomy over our mental and emotional states, too? \n' +
  'There is a way to become masters of our own minds, habits and emotional behaviours so they no longer govern how we feel and how we show up in the space. \n' +
  'Many of us move through life trapped in our minds, believing we are the thoughts in our heads, but we are not. We are the deeper conscious presence that can recognise and observe our thoughts. By delving inwards to better understand our true nature, we can venture outwards with reframed mindsets and bring about real, positive change together while still staying well. \n' +
